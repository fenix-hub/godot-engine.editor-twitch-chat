# godot-engine.editor-twitch-chat
Integrate the chat of your Twitch Channel inside Godot Engine's editor! Enable it when you are doing a dev-stream or just want to check your Twitch chat while coding.

![demo](screenshots/twitch_chat_demo.gif)

This is just an experimental project to play with Twitch APIs.  
In order to get it work you just need to know the Twitch channel's name you want to join and get a token.  
To get a token, just click on the button _"Get a token here"_ and follow the instructions.  
Once logged, your information will be stored in an encrypted file and next log will be automatically done.
